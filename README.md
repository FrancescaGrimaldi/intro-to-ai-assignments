# intro-to-ai-assignments
This repository contains all the assignments of the **"Introduction to Artificial Intelligence"** course held at NTNU during the Fall 2023 semester.

- The first one was a set of **theoretical questions** on the basics of AI, rationality and agents;
- The second required us to write an implementation of the **A\* algorithm** in order to find the shortest path between two points, representing the position of a person in different rooms of a building;
- For Assignment 3 we implemented a general solver for CSPs (**Constraint Satisfaction Problems**) using backtracking search and AC3, to solve different Sudoku boards of increasing difficulty;
- Assignment 4 was about **adversarial search**, in particular the implementation of Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning; 
- As per the last one, the fifth, we solved a problem set related to **Propositional Logic** and **First Order Logic**.
